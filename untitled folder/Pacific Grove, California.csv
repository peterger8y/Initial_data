While we adore international adventures, we also regularly road trip throughout the beautiful west.  Our most recent notable adventure as a family of 4 was to Miami, St Lucia and Dominica - our timing was incredible, as we landed back in the US *just* as news of the pandemic was heating up.  Sans kiddos we've enjoyed Paris, Brazil, South Africa, and we're eyeing New Zealand next.  We have a 6 year old, plus an toddler, and enjoy exploring the world through their eyes.

Our interests include cooking/dining, nature, travel, animals, wine, hiking, and we're big fans of the tv shows Curb Your Enthusiasm, Chef's Table, and Top Chef.

We moved to the Monterey Peninsula from Portland Oregon in the fall of '09 and haven't looked back.  (Okay, we admit, we REALLY miss the interesting assortment of people, and the incredible restaurants + fabulous food carts!)

We are passionate about the environment and do what we can to run a ""green"" household such as: recycle and compost, serve food that is organic and local, use only earth friendly cleaning/household products, etc.

Hosts since 2010, we truly enjoy meeting new people, and welcoming all of our fantastic regulars, many of which feel more like friends, at this point.

When Steinbeck resided here he formulated the plot of The Grapes of Wrath, and wrote several books including The Sea of Cortez.  This is the home he shared with his second wife, Gwyn Conger, who would become the inspiration for the lead antagonist, Kate Trask, in his epic novel, East of Eden.  In a letter to a friend, Steinbeck wrote of the cottages, “It is a pleasant little house, and we miss it… You’ll find you get a lot of thinking done in that house.” ' (from John Steinbeck, A Life in Letters).
