Foremost, thanks for taking the time out to review my listings and learn more about me.

My name is Nassly.  I have lived in NJ most of my life.   I love traveling, especially on a budget and understand the importance of having a safe and clean space to lay one's head.

I have been a host and a guest. 

As a host, I am opening my own home to  provide clean, comfortable, and budget friendly rooms in a HUMBLE home-like atmosphere.   Staying with us, is like staying at a distant family member's home.  I take pride and put much effort (elbow grease) in cleaning, maintaining, and SLOWLY upgrading my listings.  I do NOT provide luxury hotel accommodations.  If that is what you are seeking, please book at the Ritz & pay hotel prices to do so.  I do not have professional staff or offer butler service.  My home, like most bodies, has stretch marks, creaks, and minor dents.  It also has wear and tear from hosting and age. 

I am extremely honest in my listing descriptions. Please read them.

As a traveler, I have visited and backpacked through many different countries on a shoestring.  My experiences have been awesome.  

My goal is to enable others to be able to do the same. 

 Please feel free to contact me with any questions or concerns during your stay or prior to.

As a host, I am opening my own home to  provide clean, comfortable, and budget friendly rooms in a HUMBLE home-like atmosphere.   Staying with us, is like staying at a distant family member's home.  I take pride and put much effort (elbow grease) in cleaning, maintaining, and SLOWLY upgrading my listings.  I do NOT provide luxury hotel accommodations.  If that is what you are seeking, please book at the Ritz & pay hotel prices to do so.  I do not have professional staff or offer butler service.  My home, like most bodies, has stretch marks, creaks, and minor dents.  It also has wear and tear from hosting and age. 

I am extremely honest in my listing descriptions. Please read them.

As a traveler, I have visited and backpacked through many different countries on a shoestring.  My experiences have been awesome.  

My goal is to enable others to be able to do the same. 

 Please feel free to contact me with any questions or concerns during your stay or prior to.   

*******Please Note******************

For safety of my guests, my home, and myself, I provide full disclosure of myself and expect same from my guests.  

I require an accurate and clear profile picture & completed registration on  Airbnb profile, including uploading your government ID prior to check-in.

My name is Nassly.  I have lived in NJ most of my life.   I love traveling, especially on a budget and understand the importance of having a safe and clean space to lay one's head.

I have been a host and a guest. 

As a host, I am opening my own home to  provide clean, comfortable, and budget friendly rooms in a HUMBLE home-like atmosphere.   Staying with us, is like staying at a distant family member's home.  I take pride and put much effort (elbow grease) in cleaning, maintaining, and SLOWLY upgrading my listings.  I do NOT provide luxury hotel accommodations.  If that is what you are seeking, please book at the Ritz & pay hotel prices to do so.  I do not have professional staff or offer butler service.  My home, like most bodies, has stretch marks, creaks, and minor dents.  It also has wear and tear from hosting and age. 

I am extremely honest in my listing descriptions. Please read them.

As a traveler, I have visited and backpacked through many different countries on a shoestring.  My experiences have been awesome.  

My goal is to enable others to be able to do the same. 

 Please feel free to contact me with any questions or concerns during your stay or prior to.   

*******Please Note******************

For safety of my guests, my home, and myself, I provide full disclosure of myself and expect same from my guests.  

I require an accurate and clear profile picture & completed registration on  Airbnb profile, including uploading your government ID prior to check-in.  If not, your reservation will not be accepted or you will be cancelled.  Thank you for your understanding.

Paulusen operated a ferry boat and traded with the Lenepe people in the area, and is responsible for its name {Paulus Hook comes from the anglicization of Paulusen’s last name, with the “hook” designation describing the small island area seen at high tide in the early 1600s}. Through the late 1700s, Paulus Hook continued to thrive off a busy ferry service that spanned the mile journey along the water to New York City, while the Battle of Paulus Hook took place in 1779, and marked an advantageous battle for the United States during the Revolutionary War. During the late 1800s, an influx of immigrants moved to the area, which would later provide the fabric of the cultural diversity still present in JC today.",https://a0.muscache.com/pictures/b62a0119-5f9f-4f12-9f99-fc0025563a69.jpg,175743992,https://www.airbnb.com/users/show/175743992,Stephen,2018-02-27,"Jersey City, New Jersey, United States","",a few days or more,0%,80%,f,https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/user/6a9eb2c1-b78c-437a-bc14-5f1f24f8a059.jpg?aki_policy=profile_small,https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/user/6a9eb2c1-b78c-437a-bc14-5f1f24f8a059.jpg?aki_policy=profile_x_medium,,5,5,"['phone', 'work_email']",t,f,"Jersey City, New Jersey, United States",Ward E (councilmember James Solomon),,40.716,-74.03686,Private room in condominium,Private room,2,,1 shared bath,1,1,"[""Bed linens"", ""Paid parking off premises"", ""First aid kit"", ""Host greets you"", ""Carbon monoxide alarm"", ""Long term stays allowed"", ""Heating"", ""Kitchen"", ""Washer"", ""Iron"", ""Wifi"", ""Air conditioning"", ""Dedicated workspace"", ""Lock on bedroom door"", ""Essentials"", ""Dryer"", ""Smoke alarm"", ""Shampoo"", ""Fire extinguisher"", ""Hair dryer"", ""Hangers""]",$65.00,1,90,1,1,1125,1125,1.0,1125.0,,t,30,60,90,365,2021-02-22,19,0,0,2018-09-19,2020-02-15,92,10,10,10,9,10,10,,f,4,0,4,0,0.64

Foremost, thanks for taking the time out to review my listings and learn more about me.

My name is Nassly.  I have lived in NJ most of my life.   I love traveling, especially on a budget and understand the importance of having a safe and clean space to lay one's head.

I have been a host and a guest. 

As a host, I am opening my own home to  provide clean, comfortable, and budget friendly rooms in a HUMBLE home-like atmosphere.   Staying with us, is like staying at a distant family member's home.  I take pride and put much effort (elbow grease) in cleaning, maintaining, and SLOWLY upgrading my listings.  I do NOT provide luxury hotel accommodations.  If that is what you are seeking, please book at the Ritz & pay hotel prices to do so.  I do not have professional staff or offer butler service.  My home, like most bodies, has stretch marks, creaks, and minor dents.  It also has wear and tear from hosting and age. 

I am extremely honest in my listing descriptions. Please read them.

As a traveler, I have visited and backpacked through many different countries on a shoestring.  My experiences have been awesome.  

My goal is to enable others to be able to do the same. 

 Please feel free to contact me with any questions or concerns during your stay or prior to.   

*******Please Note******************

For safety of my guests, my home, and myself, I provide full disclosure of myself and expect same from my guests.  

I require an accurate and clear profile picture & completed registration on  Airbnb profile, including uploading your government ID prior to check-in.  If not, your reservation will not be accepted or you will be cancelled.  Thank you for your understanding.

My name is Ryan and I am a teacher and basketball coach here in New Jersey. I lived in Brooklyn for many years and moved to my current apartment in Jersey City a year ago.

I enjoy traveling a lot so when my apartment is available it's usually because I am off on an adventures somewhere else. When I'm home, I am out enjoying the adventures NYC has to offer pretty much every weekend, or exploring more of Jersey City. 

Jersey City is great! It's pretty much like living in another borough of the city and am super happy with my move. There is a lot to do in the area and with the Journal Square path close by and NJ transit bus up the block, you can be in the city in 30 minutes door-to-door. I hope you get to enjoy my place!

Foremost, thanks for taking the time out to review my listings and learn more about me.

My name is Nassly.  I have lived in NJ most of my life.   I love traveling, especially on a budget and understand the importance of having a safe and clean space to lay one's head.

I have been a host and a guest. 

As a host, I am opening my own home to  provide clean, comfortable, and budget friendly rooms in a HUMBLE home-like atmosphere.   Staying with us, is like staying at a distant family member's home.  I take pride and put much effort (elbow grease) in cleaning, maintaining, and SLOWLY upgrading my listings.  I do NOT provide luxury hotel accommodations.  If that is what you are seeking, please book at the Ritz & pay hotel prices to do so.  I do not have professional staff or offer butler service.  My home, like most bodies, has stretch marks, creaks, and minor dents.  It also has wear and tear from hosting and age. 

I am extremely honest in my listing descriptions. Please read them.

As a traveler, I have visited and backpacked through many different countries on a shoestring.  My experiences have been awesome.  

My goal is to enable others to be able to do the same. 

 Please feel free to contact me with any questions or concerns during your stay or prior to.   

*******Please Note******************

For safety of my guests, my home, and myself, I provide full disclosure of myself and expect same from my guests.  

I require an accurate and clear profile picture & completed registration on  Airbnb profile, including uploading your government ID prior to check-in.  If not, your reservation will not be accepted or you will be cancelled.  Thank you for your understanding.

I have lived in the NYC area for 8 years, and have been sharing my space (now spaces!) with guests since 2014. I love hosting!

I grew up in Houston, Texas, went to college in Pennsylvania, and spent time living in Italy, Spain, and Australia before moving to NYC. I currently live in Jersey City.

I am a real estate agent and property manager, and in my spare time I enjoy long walks in the neighborhood, wandering around NYC, all the self-care (massages, facials, yoga), and eating out (plus a good cocktail) with friends. 

I'm an avid traveler and have stayed with friends all over the world. I love to get a local experience when I travel, so I'm happy to provide that for my guests. My partner Mario and I host together, so you may hear or see him as well! 

Any and all questions welcome! I want to make sure you have a great time in Jersey City & NYC.

I am a native New Yorker, and love NYC!   I enjoy a variety of activities including comedy, sports, and music.   These activities keep me pretty busy especially in the evenings - if you're interested in checking out a free amateur improv comedy show, please let me know and you'll get to see me perform too.   

My ideal guest is outgoing, independent, and communicates well via text or e-mail.  I also prefer a guest that is positive and flexible.  I do my best to provide a very clean, warm environment, but things won't always be perfect.  

Also, keep in mind, this is NYC, a very expensive place, so depending on where you're from, you might be surprised that the price doesn't get you nearly as far as your hometown and the noise level will be likely on average noisier (this note is mainly for those staying in the NYC location.  The Jersey City location should be comparatively more spacious and more quiet).

Please don't hesitate to reach out if I can do anything to make your stay more comfortable.  I will do my best.   I look forward to hosting you!

Foremost, thanks for taking the time out to review my listings and learn more about me.

My name is Nassly.  I have lived in NJ most of my life.   I love traveling, especially on a budget and understand the importance of having a safe and clean space to lay one's head.

I have been a host and a guest. 

As a host, I am opening my own home to  provide clean, comfortable, and budget friendly rooms in a HUMBLE home-like atmosphere.   Staying with us, is like staying at a distant family member's home.  I take pride and put much effort (elbow grease) in cleaning, maintaining, and SLOWLY upgrading my listings.  I do NOT provide luxury hotel accommodations.  If that is what you are seeking, please book at the Ritz & pay hotel prices to do so.  I do not have professional staff or offer butler service.  My home, like most bodies, has stretch marks, creaks, and minor dents.  It also has wear and tear from hosting and age. 

I am extremely honest in my listing descriptions. Please read them.

As a traveler, I have visited and backpacked through many different countries on a shoestring.  My experiences have been awesome.  

My goal is to enable others to be able to do the same. 

 Please feel free to contact me with any questions or concerns during your stay or prior to.

For safety of my guests, my home, and myself, I provide full disclosure of myself and expect same from my guests.

I have lived in the NYC area for 8 years, and have been sharing my space (now spaces!) with guests since 2014. I love hosting!

I grew up in Houston, Texas, went to college in Pennsylvania, and spent time living in Italy, Spain, and Australia before moving to NYC. I currently live in Jersey City.

I am a real estate agent and property manager, and in my spare time I enjoy long walks in the neighborhood, wandering around NYC, all the self-care (massages, facials, yoga), and eating out (plus a good cocktail) with friends. 

I'm an avid traveler and have stayed with friends all over the world. I love to get a local experience when I travel, so I'm happy to provide that for my guests. My partner Mario and I host together, so you may hear or see him as well!

I have lived in the NYC area for 8 years, and have been sharing my space (now spaces!) with guests since 2014. I love hosting!

I grew up in Houston, Texas, went to college in Pennsylvania, and spent time living in Italy, Spain, and Australia before moving to NYC. I currently live in Jersey City.

I am a real estate agent and property manager, and in my spare time I enjoy long walks in the neighborhood, wandering around NYC, all the self-care (massages, facials, yoga), and eating out (plus a good cocktail) with friends. 

I'm an avid traveler and have stayed with friends all over the world. I love to get a local experience when I travel, so I'm happy to provide that for my guests. My partner Mario and I host together, so you may hear or see him as well! 

Any and all questions welcome! I want to make sure you have a great time in Jersey City & NYC.

The lofty office buildings, including the highly distinctive Goldman Sachs Tower, create a stunning skyline.
