I pride myself on maintaining my cottage for others so they can experience old Santa Cruz.  Traveling and surfing or maybe surfing and traveling are a few of the greatest loves in my life.

I've been humbled more than once in the ocean and on land. ;-)  Please enjoy enjoy enjoy Santa Cruz and this sweet little cottage in the heart of Pleasure Point.  Bienvenidos.

I currently reside in a historic town in the Santa Cruz Mountains, where I have a spacious property with Victorian Guest Cottages that I share with travelers.  I grow most of my own organic heirloom vegetables on the property and love to share gardening tips!
What is it like to have me as a host?  I've been told that coming to my property is like stepping back in time and is the perfect place to rejuvenate the spirit.  Guests have also appreciated having their own cottage and the privacy that comes with it.  Because I am very involved in my community, I can also give lots of tips on where to go and what to do depending on the desires of the guest.

I have lived in and around Santa Cruz for a decade now and finally decided on just the right spot (Live Oaks) and the perfect home (Alta Loma). I use it often and enjoy the environment tremendously.  For example, Stand Up Paddle in the harbor and out to sea is one of my favorite things to do - The SUP shack is minutes from my doorstep and if you're lucky, you'll see all sorts of marine life (whales too!). It's such a unique place - we even have a Saturday morning Ukelele sing-along down on the beach.  We usually get coffee at the Kind Grind (right there on the beach) and just listen.  My 4 yr. old niece has even played along with the crowd.  (Don't expect skilled musicians but do expect friendliness and old time sing-along songs.) We have a Live Oak Farmer's Market on Sunday which is fantastic too!

I love to entertain my friends and family from the East Coast at the beach house - they just cannot get over how idyllic life in Santa Cruz can be. I was born and raised outside of Boston, MA and relocated to the West Coast to work in the Software Industry. I hope you come enjoy Casa de Alta Loma and all it has to offer.
The location is ideal. You can hear the ocean, the sea lions, and the gulls but not the young neighboring renters who are right down on the beach.  It's a 3-5 minute walk to the harbor where you will find a favorite restaurant -- Johnny's Harborside.  It's a 5 minute walk to the beach which is wide and long. I often run the entire stretch from my beach down to the Santa Cruz Boardwalk all on the sand (at low tide!). It's about 13 minutes walk to the east entrance of the famous Santa Cruz Beach Boardwalk.
Driving gets you to a lot of popular destinations: E.g., Shadowbrook restaurant in Capitola is 3 miles away and SF and Big Sur are each about an hour and a half away, in opposite directions.",within an hour,100%,87%,t,https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/user/4c2522c0-3e84-41e1-aadc-ba50b0f8a2ca.jpg?aki_policy=profile_small,https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/user/4c2522c0-3e84-41e1-aadc-ba50b0f8a2ca.jpg?aki_policy=profile_x_medium,Santa Cruz,2,2,"['email', 'phone', 'reviews', 'jumio', 'offline_government_id', 'government_id']",t,t,"Santa Cruz, California, United States",City of Santa Cruz,,36.96986,-121.9981,Entire house,Entire home/apt,6,,2.5 baths,3,4,"[""Free street parking"", ""Self check-in"", ""Full kitchen"", ""Washer"", ""Heating"", ""Beach essentials"", ""Hair dryer"", ""Iron"", ""Smoke alarm"", ""Indoor fireplace"", ""Wifi"", ""Dishwasher"", ""Carbon monoxide alarm"", ""Bathroom essentials"", ""Free parking on premises"", ""Garden or backyard"", ""Bedroom comforts"", ""High chair"", ""Dryer"", ""Fire extinguisher"", ""TV"", ""Pack \u2019n Play/travel crib"", ""Coffee maker""]",$550.00,2,28,2,3,28,28,2.4,28.0,,t,11,28,58,322,2021-02-28,89,14,1,2013-12-27,2021-02-20,98,10,10,10,10,10,10,,f,2,2,0,0,1.02

Aldo's restaurant is a fun, free boat ride across to the other side of the harbor. Probably takes 10 mins.<br /><br />We are about a 15-20 min stroll to the Beach Boardwalk over some lovely sea walls and bridges.<br />It takes about 10 mins (1 mile) to get to the Seabright Brewery and restaurants on Seabright Ave. There is a pizza place, Italian pasta place, and adorable cafe over there on Seabright.<br />The house is also a 4 min walk (or less) to Harbor Cafe which is a great place for brunch and mimosas.",https://a0.muscache.com/pictures/a87349c7-c7c9-4a72-a514-8086d3b9f55c.jpg,10180211,https://www.airbnb.com/users/show/10180211,Carolyn,2013-11-21,"Alamo, California, United States","I purchased Casa de Alta Loma in 2013 as the fulfillment of a life-long dream to live close to a beautiful beach, in an environment that soothes the soul. I have lived in and around Santa Cruz for a decade now and finally decided on just the right spot (Live Oaks) and the perfect home (Alta Loma). I use it often and enjoy the environment tremendously.  For example, Stand Up Paddle in the harbor and out to sea is one of my favorite things to do - The SUP shack is minutes from my doorstep and if you're lucky, you'll see all sorts of marine life (whales too!). It's such a unique place - we even have a Saturday morning Ukelele sing-along down on the beach.  We usually get coffee at the Kind Grind (right there on the beach) and just listen.  My 4 yr. old niece has even played along with the crowd.  (Don't expect skilled musicians but do expect friendliness and old time sing-along songs.) We have a Live Oak Farmer's Market on Sunday which is fantastic too!

I love to entertain my friends and family from the East Coast at the beach house - they just cannot get over how idyllic life in Santa Cruz can be. I was born and raised outside of Boston, MA and relocated to the West Coast to work in the Software Industry. I hope you come enjoy Casa de Alta Loma and all it has to offer.
The location is ideal. You can hear the ocean, the sea lions, and the gulls but not the young neighboring renters who are right down on the beach.  It's a 3-5 minute walk to the harbor where you will find a favorite restaurant -- Johnny's Harborside.  It's a 5 minute walk to the beach which is wide and long. I often run the entire stretch from my beach down to the Santa Cruz Boardwalk all on the sand (at low tide!). It's about 13 minutes walk to the east entrance of the famous Santa Cruz Beach Boardwalk.

Years ago, I was a restauranteur in Chicago, then a full time studio potter, then a career in corporate sales and marketing.

I've traveled extensively, usually on a quest to find indigenous, traditional regional foods. Desert beans in India, grilled squid from a street vendor in Hong Kong, fresh rambutan in Thailand, black mole in Mexico, and hay soup in Austria are just a few memorable tastes. I am inspired by these experiences and I cook with international flavors.

A few years ago, I began to dream about having a farm where I could produce more of the foods, meats, and wines that I love. That dream came true when we bought FlipJack Ranch. Ranch life suits me, waking up to gather fresh eggs, cuddling the baby chicks and baby bunnies,  walking out to see the garden with a cup of coffee in hand. The whole 'farm to table' thing is real here on the ranch and the sustainable, organic and free range food products are my inspiration for daily menus. I love to forage too, here or nearby,  bringing back mushrooms, salad greens or mussels for the table. 

As a traveler myself, I value warm hospitality and those little things that make a stay memorable. I love it when I can go to a place and just unwind, assured that everything is there and I can just relax. I hope to make your stay with us memorable.

Favorite travel destinations include:
Azores Islands, Portugal - I could be a bit bias here, as my family is from the beautiful island of Pico, Azores. 
I was very fortunate to have backpacked on my own for 9 months all throughout SE Asia, New Zealand, Australia, Nepal and Hong Kong and love every one of these places. It was the best time of my life.

I absolutely love living in Santa Cruz -- how did I get so lucky? Sharing my home is a real pleasure, and so is getting to see a little slice of the world through the eyes of my guests. I enjoy playing tour director and socializing, or giving people space to bask in the peace and beauty of my home and gorgeous surroundings.
When you're here you can share lots of food I make available. Coffee, tea, toast, jam, and all your basic kitchen stuff like butter, olive oil, spices. Use cupboards / fridge for your food. Join forces and share occasional meals when we catch each other on the same schedule.  Lounge on the deck and wile away another day in paradise. It's a five minute drive to good food, deluxe markets, plain ol' safeway, lots of cafes, and best of all spectacular beaches and mountain hiking. Cute beach-village 10 minutes away is Capitola, tons of novelty shops, art, jewelry etc.
Hope to have the chance to host you for some R&R in our little slice of heaven.

Years ago, I was a restauranteur in Chicago, then a full time studio potter, then a career in corporate sales and marketing.

I've traveled extensively, usually on a quest to find indigenous, traditional regional foods. Desert beans in India, grilled squid from a street vendor in Hong Kong, fresh rambutan in Thailand, black mole in Mexico, and hay soup in Austria are just a few memorable tastes. I am inspired by these experiences and I cook with international flavors.

A few years ago, I began to dream about having a farm where I could produce more of the foods, meats, and wines that I love. That dream came true when we bought FlipJack Ranch. Ranch life suits me, waking up to gather fresh eggs, cuddling the baby chicks and baby bunnies,  walking out to see the garden with a cup of coffee in hand. The whole 'farm to table' thing is real here on the ranch and the sustainable, organic and free range food products are my inspiration for daily menus. I love to forage too, here or nearby,  bringing back mushrooms, salad greens or mussels for the table. 

As a traveler myself, I value warm hospitality and those little things that make a stay memorable. I love it when I can go to a place and just unwind, assured that everything is there and I can just relax. I hope to make your stay with us memorable.

Years ago, I was a restauranteur in Chicago, then a full time studio potter, then a career in corporate sales and marketing.

I've traveled extensively, usually on a quest to find indigenous, traditional regional foods. Desert beans in India, grilled squid from a street vendor in Hong Kong, fresh rambutan in Thailand, black mole in Mexico, and hay soup in Austria are just a few memorable tastes. I am inspired by these experiences and I cook with international flavors.

A few years ago, I began to dream about having a farm where I could produce more of the foods, meats, and wines that I love. That dream came true when we bought FlipJack Ranch. Ranch life suits me, waking up to gather fresh eggs, cuddling the baby chicks and baby bunnies,  walking out to see the garden with a cup of coffee in hand. The whole 'farm to table' thing is real here on the ranch and the sustainable, organic and free range food products are my inspiration for daily menus. I love to forage too, here or nearby,  bringing back mushrooms, salad greens or mussels for the table. 

As a traveler myself, I value warm hospitality and those little things that make a stay memorable. I love it when I can go to a place and just unwind, assured that everything is there and I can just relax. I hope to make your stay with us memorable.

In Santa Cruz, we have a cute apartment on our property that has delighted guests for almost eight years. It gets rave reviews because of the location and the nice touches.

Last year I visited India for the first time, which was a real bucket-list destination for me. Other travel goals include Peru, Argentina, Bali, Greece, and Nepal. 

My day job is managing an honors program for first-generation university students. I love my work and feel so fortunate that I actually get paid to advance diversity and inclusion in higher education. My other interests include  yoga, meditation, literature, and the arts. 

I love travel and new experiences, but I'm a terrible traveler, because I can't stand to give up my habits (for instance, I insist on bringing my favorite loose-leaf tea, chocolate, two or three books....). I also pine for our two cats when I'm away from home, so I tend to rent accommodations where the hosts mention that they have pets or other animals on the premises.

Hello to anyone reviewing my home. I hope we will meet you soon.

I am sorry to say my home is not very accessible at all. We HAVE accommodated a gentleman who just had knee surgery, and two guests with canes, who took good advantage of my staircase bannisters. 

I have a large ledge up to my front door, and my rooms are up a staircase.  My home is in a neighborhood with streetlights and sidewalks, and I have a very long driveway so you can park off the street.

Fall is upon us, and the days are crisp and sunny, while the nights are in the 40's and 50's.

The beaches are less occupied, and the community has taken on its less rushed and busy feel.

Over the years this has become somewhat of a competitive obsession in this neighborhood and it has attracted many viewers who drive through to enjoy the sights.

I now spend my time on home DIY projects and landscaping, playing, composing, and teaching music, and doing some art. 

I live in a friendly and quiet mature neighborhood on the summit of a little knoll. There is plenty of green with lots of trees, flowering shrubs and lawn. Our neighbors are friendly and we look out for one another, making it a safe and happy place. Traffic is mainly local residents; there is no through traffic.

There are at least two Chinese, three Japanese, one Thai and three Mexican restaurants and several 'American-fare' places (burgers, steaks, pancakes, pasta, vegetarian, etc) notably Heavenly Roadside Cafe, Aunt Mame's, and Mollie's Cafe. There are no fewer than seven gas stations. Also here in Scotts Valley are CineLux Theatres (12 screens with cafe and lounge), Wells Fargo, Chase, Bank of America, Los Pollos (Mexican restaurant specializing in chicken), Baskin Robbins, Jamba Juice, Winchester Auto, O'Reilly Auto, Skip's Tires, and Integrity Automotive.

My life therefore has been about relationships that matter. 
     I am a photographer.  I love travel and color and the combination of both is  ideal for me.  
     I love hosting couples, groups of women as well as their family members. I g love their complete immersion into the pleasure of our home and its' surrounding areas.  I love my reviews when people ""get it"" when it comes to our  beach home.  It's fun to hear they spent time trying to imagine the stories that went behind each segment  of decor.    I LOVE France, and then Italy, and Morocco.  Canada is up there too, because they speak French (even though I don't). 
    I also fancy myself a chef (colorful, tasteful, healthy food).   Don't forget to check out all the cookbooks and international magazines.   You will know that I love cooking when you see our custom designed kitchen, the myriad of cooking utensils, french door refrigerator, Viking Stove and Bosch Dishwasher.   The french doors off the dining area open out  to extend your eating areas and invite you for morning  a cup of coffee outside.   The french doors off the living room invite you to watch the fog roll away under the palm tree.  This is yet another thing I love.

I like changing things up from time to time so my return guests get to do it all over again.  I love exploring our area for new things for us to do as well as always keep it fun for our guests and their children.  As nice as the house is I encourage everyone to get out there and enjoy  the outside and outlying areas as well.  Nicene Marks is almost within walking distance   The beach is a short stroll.

It is a shared lovely home and I think my guests understand that and feel honored to be there.  They want to maintain our relationship and so do I.

I’ve been in Aptos my whole life, except a few years in midtown Santa Cruz. I absolutely love living on the edge of the forest that I grew up hiking in. For me, the magic of the redwood trees, ferns and moss never fades. 

My husband Mack and I raise our super sweet animals, mostly goats, as well as pigs, our amazing guardian dogs (sweet as pie with humans), and our little shiba inu/terrier mix that thinks he is the king of the castle. And of course chickens, because I love making scrumptious omelets. I had the pleasure of going through the culinary arts program at our local community college, so I am passionate about cooking. I absolutely adore teaching and sharing the things I’ve learned over the years from my incredible instructors and mentors. My latest passion has been cultivating a very strong and delicious sourdough starter. And of course making cheese, from our goats’ milk, though I put the cheesemaking on hold when we have lots of babies eating the milk. 

We very much look forward to having you come visit us and experience the fun and peaceful lifestyle of forest/beach/farm life. If you would like the full experience, please be sure to book Kinderwood Farms. Thank you!

Welcome to our Aptos beach house. A little bit about me...

I spent 15 years living and working overseas with my family in Morocco, Lithuania, and Costa Rica. I returned to California in 2015 and fell in love with Aptos and the Monterey Bay for its beautiful beaches, mountains, and access to the San Francisco Bay Area. As a beach lover, surfer, runner, and hiker, I found Aptos to be the perfect spot to enjoy nature, the beach, and the mountains all with having quick access to San Francisco to see a Giant's baseball game or to head into Oakland or Berkeley for Ethiopian, Greek, or Indian food, to see a show, or hike in the hills. 

I love adventure travel and do most of my traveling with my kids so I understand what parents are looking for in a vacation - ease and simplicity, memory making, less time in the car and more time doing fun things together, etc.  I believe that showing children the world as often and as early as possible is important. 

“Travel is fatal to prejudice, bigotry, and narrow-mindedness, and many of our people need it sorely on these accounts. Broad, wholesome, charitable views of men and things cannot be acquired by vegetating in one little corner of the earth all one's lifetime.” - Mark Twain

I hope you enjoy our home and hope that you are able to explore, learn, enjoy life's simple pleasures, and make lasting memories there.

The next two decades, I turned an avocation into a vocation, as a wine wholesaler.

Years ago, I was a restauranteur in Chicago, then a full time studio potter, then a career in corporate sales and marketing.

I've traveled extensively, usually on a quest to find indigenous, traditional regional foods. Desert beans in India, grilled squid from a street vendor in Hong Kong, fresh rambutan in Thailand, black mole in Mexico, and hay soup in Austria are just a few memorable tastes. I am inspired by these experiences and I cook with international flavors.

A few years ago, I began to dream about having a farm where I could produce more of the foods, meats, and wines that I love. That dream came true when we bought FlipJack Ranch. Ranch life suits me, waking up to gather fresh eggs, cuddling the baby chicks and baby bunnies,  walking out to see the garden with a cup of coffee in hand. The whole 'farm to table' thing is real here on the ranch and the sustainable, organic and free range food products are my inspiration for daily menus. I love to forage too, here or nearby,  bringing back mushrooms, salad greens or mussels for the table. 

As a traveler myself, I value warm hospitality and those little things that make a stay memorable. I love it when I can go to a place and just unwind, assured that everything is there and I can just relax. I hope to make your stay with us memorable.

We frequently visited them for day trips from the valley but we couldn’t stay overnight as there were no accommodations. We serendipitously came across Cliff House, situated right in the middle of our very favorite wineries, so we made a life change from a city life immersed in stress, to what has become a beautiful vacation-forever retreat for us..

The house has four separated MBR suites on the lower floor enabling privacy for up to four couples (like a hotel).  The upper floor is a dream for those who want to enjoy one of the most scenic views in California. We are also very social, so we then took the next plunge into building an AirBNB which we wanted to feel and look like a charming, traditional BNB. Privacy in a natural wonder when you want it, and a social setting on the upper floor for those who want it. The Cliff House’s 5000 SF footprint, with a 2000 SF slate deck facing the sunset over the panoramic canyons and mountains has entranced everyone we know who have visited us here.

I'm available to answer any questions you may have about any properties that I manage.   You can reach me via text or mobile phone.

I've owned the Lakeside Cottage in Arnold, Ca for 9 years now.   It's a very unique experience that our guests truly enjoy.    After successfully renting the Cottage on AirBnB and (Hidden by Airbnb) for the past several years, I've begun offering up Hosting services to friends and families who are also interested in driving additional revenue from their vacation homes.

I manage over 20 properties in Arnold, Dorrington, Bear Valley, Hayward and Santa Cruz, as well as at my home in Livermore.   Being an AirBnB host and guest allows me to pursue two of my true passions, travel and meeting people from all over the world.  



I travel extensively for both business and pleasure, and take great pride in ensuring that our guests have an unforgettable, enjoyable experience during their stay with us.

I enjoy immersing myself in the local culture when I travel, and much prefer a small, quiet getaway than a loud, rambunctious hotel, which is why I have so much in common with many of my guests.   

I'm a huge foodie and wine fan, and can usually be found checking out the local fare, outdoor activities and local wine selection during my travels!

I have two young children, 15 (Dylan) and 13 (Ava), who are the light of my life and always keep me from taking life too seriously!

Michael is an award winning experiential designer and Karimar is a dedicated PhD psychologist. Since March 2020 the live events industry shut down so Michael shifted gears and meticulously designed the two units that exist today. Microsoft, Oracle Salesforce, GE and Cisco are some of the clients that Michael has designed expositions for so this was a natural fit. Karimar also works from home so they are always available to answer any questions to make your stay as comfortable as possible. 

Surf season: October is when the waves start pumping. Santa Cruz is world renowned for it’s quality and abundance of surf spots. Our location allows for easy access to all of the spots that Michael takes advantage of. A life long surfer and waterman that has traveled the world to fill the stoke he is always available to chat about surfing. When he’s not working you’ll find him and Bonnie at the beach. If your interested in surfing lessons or Stand Up Paddling either can be arranged. If your coming specifically for surf or mountain biking we have ample secure storage and work areas if you need to make a repair.
