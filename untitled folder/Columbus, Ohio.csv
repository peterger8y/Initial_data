We have 2 daughters and 3 grandchildren, all of whom live in Columbus.  I've been a yoga teacher since 1988. I have taught at Yoga on High since it's inception in 2000 and earned my certification from Yoga Alliance of ERYT 500 at Yoga on High. I love sharing this ancient practice with all kinds of people. I have seen it have profound effects on people's lives. It is an honor and a responsibility for which I am very grateful. 
 Eric and I have lived in this historic home for over 35 years, in what we consider the best neighborhood in the city, Olde Towne. We love sharing our home with friends and now airbnb guests. We enjoy walking in the woods, gardening, biking, kayaking, reading and, of course, practicing yoga. 
We also love to travel. We've been told we are easy guests. We like to take care of ourselves and not add unduly to our hosts workload. Car camping is a favorite vacation of ours.
 I'd say our airbnb hosting style is also casual: I try to think of anything a guest might need and supply it, so they can have a relaxed stay with us. We have maps of the neighborhood and menus for the local cafes and the bakery in a notebook in The Loft. We try to help out with rides when we can. We have a table in The Loft that is perfect for working or dining. A guest set up her sewing machine up there.

People always ask if it’s weird to have strangers come and stay in my home with me and the answer has always been “not once!” I really love having the opportunity to share my home and city of Columbus Ohio with travelers from all over the world. So far I have welcomed people from 6 out of 7 continents coming from more than 50 different countries.

When I bought my home in 2008 it had broken plumbing, boarded up windows, and had been the ugly house on the block for a long time. It’s taken a lot of time and patience but a house that was forgotten and uninhabitable became a warm and charming place I like to call home. 

I’m proud of the work I’ve done to bring a historic building back to life and update it in a way that kept much of the original character. Be careful asking questions about the process because I may not stop telling stories for a while.

In the fall of 2019 I adopted a husky/boxer puppy.  Her name is Juneau and she is super friendly and loves welcoming guests to our home.

Imagine staying in a 1920 American square home with beautiful detailed woodwork, an updated kitchen with granite counter tops and top of the line stainless steel appliances, a matchless decor foyer, living room, dining room. 

:::That is just the 1st floor!:::

A beautifully landscaped backyard garden filled with amenities such as a fire pit, barbecue and beautiful lounge chairs. What I love most is when we get visits from various butterfly species, and especially the state bird the Cardinal. It really brings a smile to my face with all of the efforts, time, passion invested in the landscape garden.

I’m Jake. I’m originally from New York, and while I miss my friends and family back home (not to mention the beach!), I absolutely love my mid-west home here in Columbus, Ohio!
By day I’m a real estate investor and by night I’m a social butterfly with my friends. I'm also an Airbnb cohost where I mentor aspiring local hosts. I earned my Superhost status because I have high standards for value, cleanliness, and communication.
I enjoy travelling and creating new experiences. My favorite country is Guatemala. The people, the food and the historical sites are breathtaking. My favorite city is Chicago. Through these travels and coupled with my 14 years landlording, I’ve been fortunate to learn what makes a great host: a great home, with a friendly host, in an awesome neighborhood, and the ability to do the things you love! I try to ensure that each and every guest I host walks away with all of that and hopefully more.
My life motto is, well, really my grandmother’s advice, “Jakey, live with NO REGRETS” (I can hear her thick NYer accent now). Sometimes I guess we just need a little reminder of that… And so, I invite you to travel more and see the big, beautiful world we live in.

I’m Jake. I’m originally from New York, and while I miss my friends and family back home (not to mention the beach!), I absolutely love my mid-west home here in Columbus, Ohio!
By day I’m a real estate investor and by night I’m a social butterfly with my friends. I'm also an Airbnb cohost where I mentor aspiring local hosts. I earned my Superhost status because I have high standards for value, cleanliness, and communication.
I enjoy travelling and creating new experiences. My favorite country is Guatemala. The people, the food and the historical sites are breathtaking. My favorite city is Chicago. Through these travels and coupled with my 14 years landlording, I’ve been fortunate to learn what makes a great host: a great home, with a friendly host, in an awesome neighborhood, and the ability to do the things you love! I try to ensure that each and every guest I host walks away with all of that and hopefully more.
My life motto is, well, really my grandmother’s advice, “Jakey, live with NO REGRETS” (I can hear her thick NYer accent now). Sometimes I guess we just need a little reminder of that… And so, I invite you to travel more and see the big, beautiful world we live in.

We have travelled to many parts of the world (Mexico, Israel, Philippines, Korea, Europe) and enjoyed the different cultures as well as made many new friends.  I think this is one of the reasons we love Columbus.  There are so many different cultures here as well as their cuisines which I love to try.

Initially platted in 1814 in Columbus' South End, German Village was generally developed between years 1840 and 1914. It was settled largely by German immigrants in the mid-1800s.  German descendants at one time comprised as much as one-third of the population of Columbus.  Restoration began in 1959 and the Historic District was established in 1963.  German Village was the FIRST historic district in the U.S. and it remains a model for all that came after.  In the year 1974, German Village joined the Historic Register.  Today, more than 1,600 preservations have been completed.  <br /><br />Purdy Haus dates to at least the year 1910 when it was occupied by a woodworker/barber George C. McMillin.  Nearby homes date between years 1884 and 1888, so it may be older.<br /><br />Walk everywhere - sidewalks are wide - people are warm - parks and restaurants are plentiful!

People always ask if it’s weird to have strangers come and stay in my home with me and the answer has always been “not once!” I really love having the opportunity to share my home and city of Columbus Ohio with travelers from all over the world. So far I have welcomed people from 6 out of 7 continents coming from more than 50 different countries.

When I bought my home in 2008 it had broken plumbing, boarded up windows, and had been the ugly house on the block for a long time. It’s taken a lot of time and patience but a house that was forgotten and uninhabitable became a warm and charming place I like to call home. 

I’m proud of the work I’ve done to bring a historic building back to life and update it in a way that kept much of the original character. Be careful asking questions about the process because I may not stop telling stories for a while.

In the fall of 2019 I adopted a husky/boxer puppy.  Her name is Juneau and she is super friendly and loves welcoming guests to our home.

I’m Jake. I’m originally from New York, and while I miss my friends and family back home (not to mention the beach!), I absolutely love my mid-west home here in Columbus, Ohio!
By day I’m a real estate investor and by night I’m a social butterfly with my friends. I'm also an Airbnb cohost where I mentor aspiring local hosts. I earned my Superhost status because I have high standards for value, cleanliness, and communication.
I enjoy travelling and creating new experiences. My favorite country is Guatemala. The people, the food and the historical sites are breathtaking. My favorite city is Chicago. Through these travels and coupled with my 14 years landlording, I’ve been fortunate to learn what makes a great host: a great home, with a friendly host, in an awesome neighborhood, and the ability to do the things you love! I try to ensure that each and every guest I host walks away with all of that and hopefully more.
My life motto is, well, really my grandmother’s advice, “Jakey, live with NO REGRETS” (I can hear her thick NYer accent now). Sometimes I guess we just need a little reminder of that… And so, I invite you to travel more and see the big, beautiful world we live in.

I enjoy travelling and creating new experiences. My favorite country is Guatemala. The people, the food and the historical sites are breathtaking. My favorite city is Chicago. Through these travels and coupled with my 14 years landlording, I’ve been fortunate to learn what makes a great host: a great home, with a friendly host, in an awesome neighborhood, and the ability to do the things you love! I try to ensure that each and every guest I host walks away with all of that and hopefully more.
My life motto is, well, really my grandmother’s advice, “Jakey, live with NO REGRETS” (I can hear her thick NYer accent now). Sometimes I guess we just need a little reminder of that… And so, I invite you to travel more and see the big, beautiful world we live in.

Igor is a financial analyst that has been working in the industry for nearly a decade.

Boris and Susan are a young, professional couple originally from Lithuania and China. 

We all love to travel ourselves and try to stay at Airbnb wherever we go.

We wanted to share this house with Airbnb guests as a way to pay back the incredibly hospitality and experiences we've encountered ourselves during our travels. We know what it's like to come to a new place for the first time, especially if you have a group of people with you, and our goal is to provide you with a wonderful, cozy and unique place to stay and advice and feedback that you would expect from a friend.

My name is Kyle. My wife, Anna, and myself got married in the end of 2016. With all of our families living out of state/country, we have grown accustomed to having others staying with us over, and so finished our basement to allow others to use our space.

I’m Jake. I’m originally from New York, and while I miss my friends and family back home (not to mention the beach!), I absolutely love my mid-west home here in Columbus, Ohio!
By day I’m a real estate investor and by night I’m a social butterfly with my friends. I'm also an Airbnb cohost where I mentor aspiring local hosts. I earned my Superhost status because I have high standards for value, cleanliness, and communication.
I enjoy travelling and creating new experiences. My favorite country is Guatemala. The people, the food and the historical sites are breathtaking. My favorite city is Chicago. Through these travels and coupled with my 14 years landlording, I’ve been fortunate to learn what makes a great host: a great home, with a friendly host, in an awesome neighborhood, and the ability to do the things you love! I try to ensure that each and every guest I host walks away with all of that and hopefully more.
My life motto is, well, really my grandmother’s advice, “Jakey, live with NO REGRETS” (I can hear her thick NYer accent now). Sometimes I guess we just need a little reminder of that… And so, I invite you to travel more and see the big, beautiful world we live in.
