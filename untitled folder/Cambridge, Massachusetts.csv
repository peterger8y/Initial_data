¡Bienvenidos a La Casa de Karma!

We wanted a name that embodies our feelings and philosophy around hosting, and essentially it is about karma- the notion that our actions and intentions will come back to us and influence our future, whether they be positive or negative. Karma is similar to the golden rule of “treat others the way you want to be treated."" We believe that this is a good way to go through the world and attempt to always practice this with our guests. We will try to always treat you with loving kindness and respect, and we expect the same from our guests--that they treat the folks running the house, other guests in the house, and the space itself, with respect and kindness.

This Victorian house built in the 1880s and still has many of the quirks from that era. Around 30 years ago our family bought the property, and in 2013 we started managing and renovating its 6 apartments and established the Cambridge Karma House LLC!

We enjoy hosting our guests & we look forward to meeting you! Please let us know if you need anything or have questions.

We try to always be friendly and caring to our guests so please do let us know if there's anything we can do to make your stay more comfortable.

CHECK-IN=any time after 3pm*

CHECK-OUT=12 noon or earlier*

*if you need to check in before 3pm or check out after 12 noon, please let us know and we will *try* to accommodate you (you MUST receive a confirmation that this is okay). If we’re not able to accommodate you with an early check-in or late check-out time, we are almost always able to offer our guests the ability to store their luggage in the basement during non-apartment-stay hours.

---> The details of our check-in and check-out procedures are *automatically* emailed to confirmed guests by airbnb through our “House Manual”; the House Manual covers a variety of topics but we ask that you ****privilege what is written here**** regarding parking, plumbing, tidiness + cleanliness, and waste disposal (we are in the process of updating the House Manuals on all of our listings but sometimes our systems, etc. change this places is the quickest go-to place to relay/outline what we need our guests to know and/or do). 

IMPORTANT NOTES (parking, plumbing, tidiness + cleanliness, and waste disposal)*:

*Please privilege guest expectations and procedures written here over those received in the ""House Manual”

**************PARKING**************:

We canNOT offer parking to most of our guests. We have 1 visitors parking pass for 6 units (maximum 3 days in a row in the zone indicated behind the pass (to be placed on the dashboard) & the vehicle must be moved every 24 hours); if you want the pass YOU MUST ASK us *****AND**** receive a message confirming that, indeed, you may use it (it is in high demand and often unavailable).

Due to the limited availability of parking in Cambridge (both through the house and in Cambridge overall), we suggest you not bring a car.

**************PLUMBING**************

While there are many fantastic and charming features of the old Victorian house, the old pipes are not one of them! Therefore:

YOU ***MUST*** USE THE HAIR AND FOOD CATCHERS IN ALL OF THE DRAINS. Indeed, WATER (/polarity bonded liquids (no oil)) IS THE ONLY THING THAT CAN GO DOWN THE SINKS AND TUB. Not doing so will clog up the pipes; if we need to call the plumber we may keep part, all of your security deposit to remedy the situation.

**************TIDINESS & CLEANLINESS of Your Living Space When Checking Out**************

There is a short window period between checking-in and checking-out and oftentimes we are booked back to back with multiple apartments to prepare. If your apartment takes more than about an hour to clean it is likely we will draw from your deposit for this extra service of your apartment requiring a deep cleaning after you check out. Crumbs and food all over the tables and counters (or food in the trash; see below under ""Compost""!), spilled products on the bathroom sink, this is not what we expect to encounter to turn around the apartment to the next guest. The apartments are large and wiping all the surfaces down, cleaning the floors and changing the bedding and towels in the most basic way usually takes about an hour. In a way we're trying to clean invisible things (germs, finger prints, dust, etc.) form one guest to the next; when we clean and prepare apartments we do not expect to have to pick-up-after-you.

A my j**************WASTE DISPOSAL: COMPOSTING + RECYCLING + TRASH************** :

Our Earth is under seriously strained circumstances in terms of how much toxic matter humans are exposing it to, and as such, we take waste production seriously. The best sustainable practice mantra is (in this order): reduce, reuse, recycle.

GUESTS STAYING UNDER ONE WEEK:

Please leave your trash, recyclables and compost INSIDE of the apartment and KINDLY DO NOT take it outside. If you need to take it out for some reason, please see the “where"" section for each type of waste.

GUESTS STAYING OVER ONE WEEK:

Take your trash, recyclables and compost to the 19 side of the house and put them IN THE PROPER BINS (if you are unable to do so for medical reasons, please let us know and we will gladly do this for you!). The trash and recycling is collected at around 7am Wednesday morning (one day later on weeks where there are national holidays);

********TRASH********

WHAT? anything that is NOT compostable (food) or recyclable (paper, glass, aluminum, plastic). Examples: styrofoam, dirt and hair (though these last 2 can put in the garden)….most (clean) materials can be recycled! :-)

WHERE? Indoors: in the bin marked “Trash.” Outdoors: in the BLACK OR GREY bins (these are smaller than the recycling bins).

HOW? In TIGHTLY SEALED PLASTIC BAGS. You CANNOT leave the bags unsealed (this disrespects the folks collecting the trash by risking waste falling out while disposing of it) and/or the City will reject the bin likely fine us (and we will have no qualms about passing this on to you (by withholding your security deposit).

********RECYCLING********

WHAT?

Paper (example: receipts, newspaper, tissues, cereal boxes)

Glass (for example:bottles),

Aluminum (for example:cans)

Hard Plastics (for example: your clean (see below) yoghurt containers, to-go food containers, etc.….*****You must KEEP SOFT PLASTICS (for example: plastic bags) SEPARATE from other recyclable materials*****; these clog the recycling sorting machine. We put these together outside (either in a small bin by the compost wheel and/or in a large bag full of soft plastics (mostly bags)!

** VERY IMPORTANT NOTE: all materials MUST BE CLEAN. This means that you have to rinse out you milk cartons, clean out containers containing food (put excess food in the compost (**NEVER down the sink drain**; see “Plumbing”).

WHERE?

Indoors: in the bin marked “Recycling.”

Outdoors: in the LARGE NAVY BLUE BINS (everything goes in there EXCEPT for your soft plastics (for example: plastic bags); put these in the small container by the compost wheel or in a large plastic bag full of soft plastics).

vHOW?

WI
********COMPOST********

I N sA Isis WHAT?

IAll of your food scraps (for example: fruits peels, tea bags, coffee grinds, vegetable scraps, etc.) EXCEPT for meat and dairy (egg shells are fine!). What do do with these food caught in the kitchen sink? Throw it in the zip lock bag in the freezer :)

¡Bienvenidos a La Casa de Karma!

We wanted a name that embodies our feelings and philosophy around hosting, and essentially it is about karma- the notion that our actions and intentions will come back to us and influence our future, whether they be positive or negative. Karma is similar to the golden rule of “treat others the way you want to be treated."" We believe that this is a good way to go through the world and attempt to always practice this with our guests. We will try to always treat you with loving kindness and respect, and we expect the same from our guests--that they treat the folks running the house, other guests in the house, and the space itself, with respect and kindness.

This Victorian house built in the 1880s and still has many of the quirks from that era. Around 30 years ago our family bought the property, and in 2013 we started managing and renovating its 6 apartments and established the Cambridge Karma House LLC!

We enjoy hosting our guests & we look forward to meeting you! Please let us know if you need anything or have questions.

We try to always be friendly and caring to our guests so please do let us know if there's anything we can do to make your stay more comfortable.

CHECK-IN=any time after 3pm*

CHECK-OUT=12 noon or earlier*

*if you need to check in before 3pm or check out after 12 noon, please let us know and we will *try* to accommodate you (you MUST receive a confirmation that this is okay). If we’re not able to accommodate you with an early check-in or late check-out time, we are almost always able to offer our guests the ability to store their luggage in the basement during non-apartment-stay hours.

---> The details of our check-in and check-out procedures are *automatically* emailed to confirmed guests by airbnb through our “House Manual”; the House Manual covers a variety of topics but we ask that you ****privilege what is written here**** regarding parking, plumbing, tidiness + cleanliness, and waste disposal (we are in the process of updating the House Manuals on all of our listings but sometimes our systems, etc. change this places is the quickest go-to place to relay/outline what we need our guests to know and/or do). 

IMPORTANT NOTES (parking, plumbing, tidiness + cleanliness, and waste disposal)*:

*Please privilege guest expectations and procedures written here over those received in the ""House Manual”

**************PARKING**************:

We canNOT offer parking to most of our guests. We have 1 visitors parking pass for 6 units (maximum 3 days in a row in the zone indicated behind the pass (to be placed on the dashboard) & the vehicle must be moved every 24 hours); if you want the pass YOU MUST ASK us *****AND**** receive a message confirming that, indeed, you may use it (it is in high demand and often unavailable).

Due to the limited availability of parking in Cambridge (both through the house and in Cambridge overall), we suggest you not bring a car.

**************PLUMBING**************

While there are many fantastic and charming features of the old Victorian house, the old pipes are not one of them! Therefore:

YOU ***MUST*** USE THE HAIR AND FOOD CATCHERS IN ALL OF THE DRAINS. Indeed, WATER (/polarity bonded liquids (no oil)) IS THE ONLY THING THAT CAN GO DOWN THE SINKS AND TUB. Not doing so will clog up the pipes; if we need to call the plumber we may keep part, all of your security deposit to remedy the situation.

**************TIDINESS & CLEANLINESS of Your Living Space When Checking Out**************

There is a short window period between checking-in and checking-out and oftentimes we are booked back to back with multiple apartments to prepare. If your apartment takes more than about an hour to clean it is likely we will draw from your deposit for this extra service of your apartment requiring a deep cleaning after you check out. Crumbs and food all over the tables and counters (or food in the trash; see below under ""Compost""!), spilled products on the bathroom sink, this is not what we expect to encounter to turn around the apartment to the next guest. The apartments are large and wiping all the surfaces down, cleaning the floors and changing the bedding and towels in the most basic way usually takes about an hour. In a way we're trying to clean invisible things (germs, finger prints, dust, etc.) form one guest to the next; when we clean and prepare apartments we do not expect to have to pick-up-after-you.

A my j**************WASTE DISPOSAL: COMPOSTING + RECYCLING + TRASH************** :

Our Earth is under seriously strained circumstances in terms of how much toxic matter humans are exposing it to, and as such, we take waste production seriously. The best sustainable practice mantra is (in this order): reduce, reuse, recycle.

GUESTS STAYING UNDER ONE WEEK:

Please leave your trash, recyclables and compost INSIDE of the apartment and KINDLY DO NOT take it outside. If you need to take it out for some reason, please see the “where"" section for each type of waste.

GUESTS STAYING OVER ONE WEEK:

Take your trash, recyclables and compost to the 19 side of the house and put them IN THE PROPER BINS (if you are unable to do so for medical reasons, please let us know and we will gladly do this for you!). The trash and recycling is collected at around 7am Wednesday morning (one day later on weeks where there are national holidays);

********TRASH********

WHAT? anything that is NOT compostable (food) or recyclable (paper, glass, aluminum, plastic). Examples: styrofoam, dirt and hair (though these last 2 can put in the garden)….most (clean) materials can be recycled! :-)

WHERE? Indoors: in the bin marked “Trash.” Outdoors: in the BLACK OR GREY bins (these are smaller than the recycling bins).

HOW? In TIGHTLY SEALED PLASTIC BAGS. You CANNOT leave the bags unsealed (this disrespects the folks collecting the trash by risking waste falling out while disposing of it) and/or the City will reject the bin likely fine us (and we will have no qualms about passing this on to you (by withholding your security deposit).

********RECYCLING********

WHAT?

Paper (example: receipts, newspaper, tissues, cereal boxes)

Glass (for example:bottles),

Aluminum (for example:cans)

Hard Plastics (for example: your clean (see below) yoghurt containers, to-go food containers, etc.….*****You must KEEP SOFT PLASTICS (for example: plastic bags) SEPARATE from other recyclable materials*****; these clog the recycling sorting machine. We put these together outside (either in a small bin by the compost wheel and/or in a large bag full of soft plastics (mostly bags)!

** VERY IMPORTANT NOTE: all materials MUST BE CLEAN. This means that you have to rinse out you milk cartons, clean out containers containing food (put excess food in the compost (**NEVER down the sink drain**; see “Plumbing”).

WHERE?

Indoors: in the bin marked “Recycling.”

Outdoors: in the LARGE NAVY BLUE BINS (everything goes in there EXCEPT for your soft plastics (for example: plastic bags); put these in the small container by the compost wheel or in a large plastic bag full of soft plastics).

vHOW?

WI
********COMPOST********

I N sA Isis WHAT?

IAll of your food scraps (for example: fruits peels, tea bags, coffee grinds, vegetable scraps, etc.) EXCEPT for meat and dairy (egg shells are fine!). What do do with these food caught in the kitchen sink? Throw it in the zip lock bag in the freezer :)

Depending on the location, you can stay for just a few days, a week, a month or more. 

We offer an assortment of short-term apartments in sizes ranging from a studio to three bedrooms that are fully furnished with all the comforts of home. Our local staff meticulously prepares your apartment before your arrival, and we offer 24 hour assistance for any emergencies after business hours. When you arrive at your apartment, the beds will be made, towels and bath amenities will be stocked in the bathrooms, and the coffee maker will be set up in the kitchen with some sample coffees, sweetener and creamer (teabags too if that is your preference) to start your morning off properly. If you’d like to cook a meal, the kitchen is stocked with dishes, cutlery, glassware and pots and pans. The living room is set up with a TV and cable channels, and the Wi-Fi router password and instructions will be prominently displayed so you can get connected quickly. You can also make local and toll-free phone calls at no charge. 

Please contact us to confirm the exact availability of the apartment you are interested in. We’d love to host you (and your family) for your vacation or business trip.

¡Bienvenidos a La Casa de Karma!

We wanted a name that embodies our feelings and philosophy around hosting, and essentially it is about karma- the notion that our actions and intentions will come back to us and influence our future, whether they be positive or negative. Karma is similar to the golden rule of “treat others the way you want to be treated."" We believe that this is a good way to go through the world and attempt to always practice this with our guests. We will try to always treat you with loving kindness and respect, and we expect the same from our guests--that they treat the folks running the house, other guests in the house, and the space itself, with respect and kindness.

This Victorian house built in the 1880s and still has many of the quirks from that era. Around 30 years ago our family bought the property, and in 2013 we started managing and renovating its 6 apartments and established the Cambridge Karma House LLC!

We enjoy hosting our guests & we look forward to meeting you! Please let us know if you need anything or have questions.

We try to always be friendly and caring to our guests so please do let us know if there's anything we can do to make your stay more comfortable.

CHECK-IN=any time after 3pm*

CHECK-OUT=12 noon or earlier*

*if you need to check in before 3pm or check out after 12 noon, please let us know and we will *try* to accommodate you (you MUST receive a confirmation that this is okay). If we’re not able to accommodate you with an early check-in or late check-out time, we are almost always able to offer our guests the ability to store their luggage in the basement during non-apartment-stay hours.

---> The details of our check-in and check-out procedures are *automatically* emailed to confirmed guests by airbnb through our “House Manual”; the House Manual covers a variety of topics but we ask that you ****privilege what is written here**** regarding parking, plumbing, tidiness + cleanliness, and waste disposal (we are in the process of updating the House Manuals on all of our listings but sometimes our systems, etc. change this places is the quickest go-to place to relay/outline what we need our guests to know and/or do). 

IMPORTANT NOTES (parking, plumbing, tidiness + cleanliness, and waste disposal)*:

*Please privilege guest expectations and procedures written here over those received in the ""House Manual”

**************PARKING**************:

We canNOT offer parking to most of our guests. We have 1 visitors parking pass for 6 units (maximum 3 days in a row in the zone indicated behind the pass (to be placed on the dashboard) & the vehicle must be moved every 24 hours); if you want the pass YOU MUST ASK us *****AND**** receive a message confirming that, indeed, you may use it (it is in high demand and often unavailable).

Due to the limited availability of parking in Cambridge (both through the house and in Cambridge overall), we suggest you not bring a car.

**************PLUMBING**************

While there are many fantastic and charming features of the old Victorian house, the old pipes are not one of them! Therefore:

YOU ***MUST*** USE THE HAIR AND FOOD CATCHERS IN ALL OF THE DRAINS. Indeed, WATER (/polarity bonded liquids (no oil)) IS THE ONLY THING THAT CAN GO DOWN THE SINKS AND TUB. Not doing so will clog up the pipes; if we need to call the plumber we may keep part, all of your security deposit to remedy the situation.

**************TIDINESS & CLEANLINESS of Your Living Space When Checking Out**************

There is a short window period between checking-in and checking-out and oftentimes we are booked back to back with multiple apartments to prepare. If your apartment takes more than about an hour to clean it is likely we will draw from your deposit for this extra service of your apartment requiring a deep cleaning after you check out. Crumbs and food all over the tables and counters (or food in the trash; see below under ""Compost""!), spilled products on the bathroom sink, this is not what we expect to encounter to turn around the apartment to the next guest. The apartments are large and wiping all the surfaces down, cleaning the floors and changing the bedding and towels in the most basic way usually takes about an hour. In a way we're trying to clean invisible things (germs, finger prints, dust, etc.) form one guest to the next; when we clean and prepare apartments we do not expect to have to pick-up-after-you.

A my j**************WASTE DISPOSAL: COMPOSTING + RECYCLING + TRASH************** :

Our Earth is under seriously strained circumstances in terms of how much toxic matter humans are exposing it to, and as such, we take waste production seriously. The best sustainable practice mantra is (in this order): reduce, reuse, recycle.

GUESTS STAYING UNDER ONE WEEK:

Please leave your trash, recyclables and compost INSIDE of the apartment and KINDLY DO NOT take it outside. If you need to take it out for some reason, please see the “where"" section for each type of waste.

GUESTS STAYING OVER ONE WEEK:

Take your trash, recyclables and compost to the 19 side of the house and put them IN THE PROPER BINS (if you are unable to do so for medical reasons, please let us know and we will gladly do this for you!). The trash and recycling is collected at around 7am Wednesday morning (one day later on weeks where there are national holidays);

********TRASH********

WHAT? anything that is NOT compostable (food) or recyclable (paper, glass, aluminum, plastic). Examples: styrofoam, dirt and hair (though these last 2 can put in the garden)….most (clean) materials can be recycled! :-)

WHERE? Indoors: in the bin marked “Trash.” Outdoors: in the BLACK OR GREY bins (these are smaller than the recycling bins).

HOW? In TIGHTLY SEALED PLASTIC BAGS. You CANNOT leave the bags unsealed (this disrespects the folks collecting the trash by risking waste falling out while disposing of it) and/or the City will reject the bin likely fine us (and we will have no qualms about passing this on to you (by withholding your security deposit).

********RECYCLING********

WHAT?

Paper (example: receipts, newspaper, tissues, cereal boxes)

Glass (for example:bottles),

Aluminum (for example:cans)

Hard Plastics (for example: your clean (see below) yoghurt containers, to-go food containers, etc.….*****You must KEEP SOFT PLASTICS (for example: plastic bags) SEPARATE from other recyclable materials*****; these clog the recycling sorting machine. We put these together outside (either in a small bin by the compost wheel and/or in a large bag full of soft plastics (mostly bags)!

** VERY IMPORTANT NOTE: all materials MUST BE CLEAN. This means that you have to rinse out you milk cartons, clean out containers containing food (put excess food in the compost (**NEVER down the sink drain**; see “Plumbing”).

WHERE?

Indoors: in the bin marked “Recycling.”

Outdoors: in the LARGE NAVY BLUE BINS (everything goes in there EXCEPT for your soft plastics (for example: plastic bags); put these in the small container by the compost wheel or in a large plastic bag full of soft plastics).

vHOW?

WI
********COMPOST********

I N sA Isis WHAT?

IAll of your food scraps (for example: fruits peels, tea bags, coffee grinds, vegetable scraps, etc.) EXCEPT for meat and dairy (egg shells are fine!). What do do with these food caught in the kitchen sink? Throw it in the zip lock bag in the freezer :)

Regarding our Cape Cod listing:
My mother and her family began renting a cottage on Ocean Avenue back in the 1920s  when she was a teenager and she and my father  bought a cottage on this street in 1954. In the early 1960s, they purchased ""The Cape Codder"".  We were fortunate to be able to spend many of our summers as children in this neighborhood, which has not changed much since that time.  Generations of the same families return every season to this place we all call ""home"" as it is filled with memories of relaxed childhood summers with our extended families.  We look forward to sharing this experience with others!

Regarding our Cambridge listing:
Part of my mother's family emigrated to Cambridge at the turn of last century from Co. Kerry, Ireland, taking up residence in our Hollis Street neighborhood that was once called ""Little Dublin"". Her cousins became successful funeral home owners and leaders in the Cambridge community. This neighborhood was also home to the famous House Speaker, ""Tip"" O'Neil, and has a rich history, dating back to the Revolutionary War.

Private bathroom and kitchen accommodations are available. Some listings may indicate shared spaces but due to low occupancy rate, private bathroom and kitchen might be possible.  Self check-in/out will allow for social distancing here. COVID-19 responders will receive 10% on any bookings at this time. 
As you can see in almost all of reviews from previous guests, we hold cleanliness to a high standard and clean apartment is our priority. 

To prevent the spread of the coronavirus (COVID-19), we have implemented a comprehensive cleaning and sanitizing protocol. This includes sanitizing tables, counters, door and cabinet knobs.

I’d like to also ask all guests to follow CDC and the Massachusetts Department of Health guidelines and recommended techniques and updates. 

Thank you so much for your understanding and cooperation.

King bed, en suite bathroom, offering good value for two people.  Off street family home, quiet yet yards away from all the action. The room is mostly taken up by the bed.

The bed is quite low so not suitable for older people. The shower head is new but the bathtub is old, and has a few hard water stains by the tap.

Thanks for checking out my properties!  

My name is Dawn and I have been living in beautiful historical Charlestown for the last 16 years. My property is near and dear to my heart as this was my grandparents home that I pretty much grew up in and that I bought after they passed away. I recently decided to turn my beautiful peice of property into a place where visitors can come and enjoy all this wonderful city has to offer while staying in a place of history vs a hotel!
